# Test Peviitor API with Postman

This project is designed to test the process of uploading jobs through scrapers-ui, ensuring the integrity of the data. The primary focus is on validating job details such as title, city, county, and link in the Peviitor API. 
To achieve this goal, the project will leverage Postman, a widely-used API testing tool renowned for its effectiveness in conducting efficient tests, automating processes, and validating API endpoints.

## Features

The project incorporates the following key features:


- API Testing: In-depth testing of API Responses to increase data accuracy and reliability through multiple assertions.
- Data Validation: Verification of the scraped data against the information available in the Peviitor API.
- Collection and Newman Integration: Ability to run the entire collection through collection runner and newman for efficient execution and monitoring of tests.
- Jenkins Pipeline Script: Seamless integration with Jenkins through a dedicated pipeline script for automated testing
- Data-Driven Testing: Implementation of data-driven testing to enhance test coverage and flexibility.
- HTML Reporting through Newman: Utilization of Newman for HTML reporting, providing clear insights into test results.
- Data Export from Collection Run Results: Easy extraction and export of data from collection run results in json format for further analysis and reporting.
